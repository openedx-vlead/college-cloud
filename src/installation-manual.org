* Introduction
  This manual details the configuration/workflow process to be
  followed for Virtual Labs College Cloud Edition. The College Cloud
  machine/server will be running without GUI. GUI has been disabled
  for better performance results.  

  Virtual Labs College Cloud Edition
  is the Portable-Edition for Virtual Labs. It offers the offline
  version of Virtual labs, experiments and theoretical content. This
  edition addresses the lack of internet access or poor internet
  connectivity across different institutes/colleges. It results in a
  very cost-effective Learning Management System.

* Requirements
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: requirements
  :END:    

  1. College Cloud System Configuration (recommended) 
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      Processor : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 , CPU with 3.40GHz (Model : intel-db75en) 
      RAM : 16 GB 
      SMPS : 600 W 
      CPUs: 8
      MotherBoard wattage: 77 W 
     #+END_EXAMPLE
  2. 500 GB SATA  ( Hard Disk Drive - HDD)- College Cloud Edition
  3. WiFi Router
  4. Computer Lab with at least 30-50 Systems/Desktops.
  5. Network Switch Input, from where all the labs would obtain DHCP
     IP) to Computer Lab machines/Desktops. This would make College
     Cloud accessible over the LAN network providing better results.
  6. System Administrator with basic knowledge of CentOS operating systems and
     networking.
    
* Configuring College Cloud Server
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: cc-server
  :END:    

  1. Configure WiFi-Router ::  Router would need to serve 10.2.57.0/24
       to its clients. This would need configuration of LAN settings
       in the router such that router's dhcp server would serve IPs
       from the above IP range to its clients.
  2. Connect the identified College Cloud machine to the configured
     Wi-Fi router through a LAN cable. *Please do not touch the WAN
     port*.
  3. Connect the College Cloud Edition Hard Disk Drive to the
     identified College Cloud machine.
  4. Boot the machine from College Cloud Edition Hard Disk Drive.
  5. Please use [[./installation-manual.org::#passwords][default linux user credentials]] to login.
     + NOTE :: It is advised that the password is changed after the
               first login . To change the password, follow the [[./installation-manual.org::#passwords][link]]
** Launch Virtual Labs (Open edX) platform
   1. Run the following command on terminal to run Virtual Labs on Open
      edX platform. This may take a few minutes to launch the platform.
       #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       cd vagrant-boxes
       vagrant-boxes$vagrant up     #Look for Vagrant file in "vlabs" account and run this command
       vagrant-boxes$vagrant up --provision
       #+END_EXAMPLE
   2. College Cloud edition of Virtual Labs is now ready for use.
* Passwords
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: passwords

   - Once logged into the web panel: 

     1. Look for =localhost= on left side of the panel.
     2. Click on =localhost=.
     3. A list all labs with their respective OpenVZ container
	status(stopped/running) would be visible.

   - WARNING :: *Please do not tamper  with the college cloud
                setup settings.*

** Starting Lab containers
    1. Go to the platform http://vlabs.ac.in
    2. Select the course/lab to be included in the workshop. Please
       make a note of the course/lab name.
    3. Go to =http://<College-Cloud-Machine-IP>:3000= 
    4. Sign into =OpenVZ web panel=. For credentials, please follow
       the [[./installation-manual.org::#passwords][link]] .
    5. Click on =localhost= located at left side of the panel.
    6. Search for the lab name that has been selected in step 2.
    7. Choose the selected lab by clicking on CTID (example.213) and
       look for =change state= button on the panel.
    8. Select =start= and wait for about 1-2 minutes. 
    9. Observe the change of color of the selected course/lab in green
       color and running state.

** Enabling Labs
   College Cloud Edition has 71 labs available across various
   disciplines and domains. It is adviced to have upto a maximum of 5
   Labs running at any given time. All other labs will be visible on
   Lab Catalogue.  To allow the students to use the Labs that were
   [[Starting Lab containers][started]] on the OpenVZ web panel, follow the steps given below -
  
   1. Visit http://vlabs.ac.in:18010/ to open Studio of College Cloud
      Edition.
   2. Login using [[Passwords][admin credentials]] .
          + NOTE :: It is advised that the password is changed after
                    the first login . For the steps for changing the

** Enhancing Performance
   1. If an *Intel i7 processor and 16GB RAM machine/system* is being
      used a maximum of 50-100 simultaneous users can access one lab
      at a time.
   2. It is adviced to have upto a maximum of 5 Labs running at any
      given time.
   3. The best choice would be start one lab at a time and have
      maximum of 10 labs running at any given instance.
	
** Monitoring system resources
   [[https://www.nagios.org/][Nagios]] is used for monitoring systems resources such as load on the
   machine, RAM usage, Processes, etc.

** Analytics and Feedback : Workshop Coordinator
   The workshop coordinator should follow the following steps to
   collect and share analytics logs with Virtual Central Repository.
   
   1. [[./installation-manual.org::#registration][Register]] to College Cloud Edition (if not already done)
      Note :: 
      1. Visit the URL -
         =http://<college-cloud-server-ip>/cc_registration/get_cc_mac_id=
         to know the MAC address of the college cloud and save this
         for the future reference.
      2. The MAC address is useful for computing usage for offline
